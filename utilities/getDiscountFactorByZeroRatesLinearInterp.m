function df = getDiscountFactorByZeroRatesLinearInterp(refDate, interpDate, dates, discount_factors)
% GETDISCOUNTFACTORBYZERORATESLINEARINTERP calculates the discount factor 
% for a specific target date (interpDate) by performing linear interpolation 
% on the continuously compounded zero-coupon spot rates.
%
%   Input arguments:
%     refDate : Reference date (Settlement Date) of the curve.
%     interpDate : Target date for which the discount factor is required.
%     dates : Vector of dates corresponding to the discount factors (including refDate).
%     discount_factors : Vector of discount factors (DF) at the curve nodes.
%
%   Output arguments:
%     df : Interpolated discount factor for the target date.

    % Extract node maturities in years (ACT/365)
    T_nodes = yearfrac(refDate, dates(2:end), 3);
    
    % Compute continuously compounded zero rates at the curve nodes
    z_nodes = fromDiscountFactorsToZeroRates(refDate, dates, discount_factors);
    
    % Compute maturity for the target interpolation date
    T_target = yearfrac(refDate, interpDate, 3);
    
    % Perform linear interpolation on zero rates (with extrapolation enabled)
    z_interp = interp1(T_nodes, z_nodes, T_target, 'linear', 'extrap');
    
    % Reconvert the interpolated zero rate back into a discount factor
    df = exp(-z_interp .* T_target);
